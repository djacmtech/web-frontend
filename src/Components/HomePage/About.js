                        ACM, the world's largest educational and scientific computing society,
                        delivers resources that advance computing as a science and a profession.
                        Since its inception in our college in 2007-2008, DJSCOE-ACM has established
                        itself as a successful committee, not only in terms of the number of members
                        who have become a part of the ACM family but also in terms of the activities
                        and seminars/workshops that have been conducted.
                    </p>

                        Don't let us convince you about our success.
                        Let our three consecutive Best Student Chapter
                        of the Year awards do the talking.
